// All modifications since that commit are my own.

// In short, my goals for wrapping the Habitica (HabitRPG) API are quite different.
// At least initially, I am not trying to wrap the complete API, and I am using
// a different approach to mechanics of wrapping the API. Finally I am working
// with Habitica API v3 while habitrpg-api-dotnet-client has been written for
// API v2. Thus I am not motivated to update the entire habitrpg-api-dotnet-client
// code to APIv3. However, the model classes are mostly exactly what I need.
// So rather than write a set of nearly identical JSON.Net annoted serialisation
// classes, I am reusing these here. Both projects are Apache v2 licensed, so
// by distributing this code with the same license, along with this header giving
// acknowledgement of the original source, and the indication of the modifications
// I have made (via GitHub commits) I believe I am in compliance with the terms
// of the Apache V2 license.
