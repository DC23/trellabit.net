# habitrpg-api-dotnet-client classes
The habitrpg-api-dotnet-client model classes are written for Habitica API v2.
Although I expect a lot of the structure will be the same for v3, there are
significant changes. I have therefore placed the original files in the unvetted
folder, and changed the namespace. As I check and update model classes I will
move them back into the main Model namespace.

Once done, I could probably use this work as the basis for bringing the
habitrpg-api-dotnet-client project up to date with v3.
